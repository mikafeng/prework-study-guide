# prework-study-guide

## Description
 - The prework study guide was created to help new bootcamp students have one location to access their notes for the program. As there is a lot of information being learned throughout the bootcamp, this application allows content to be sorted and easily accessed in one spot. In creating the prework study guide I learned the basics of html, css, and javascript. I also learned how to sync my code on my local computer to GitHub so that peers can have access to my code for the application.


## Installation

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide has four sections (Html, CSS, Git, Javascript) with notes in each section. The DevTools console will show the JavaScript running and can help a student decide which topic to study first.
